# Python Portscanner

A simple Python implementation of a portscanner. It allows the option to scan for 1 specific port or ports 1 - 1024.

### Note

By default the program was designed to run on a Linux environment, however it will work on Windows.
The only problem would be the "clear" command that is used to clear clutter from the initial start of the program.

### Prerequisites

Python 3

## Running the portscanner

```
python port_scanner.py
```
